And with consternation and conversation, some internal, some external, I talked myself out of every little thing that could lead to me making those relationships tighter that could bring me from me into a better man; a soldier of love unwalked upon the earth for fear of mines and pitfall traps. One whose stronger natures trended toward past delights so strongly as to erase the present and future all at once, an ocean of possibility made thin by the backwaters of his past. Just once, I hope, I will be able to make past and present coexist as a thin line of open shore upon which I can sit and let the land wash out from under me, thighs, calves, heels, leaving impressions that will vanish as soon as I get up and the next tide comes in, leaving me washed, anew, and a bit too sandy to get to bed right away, which is nothing that a little shower won’t fix, my sun-abraded cheeks and sand-abraded everywhere else rubbed raw with time and wriggling, but not past the point of permanency; no, it was worth a romp in the sand, a chance to show my body off to the ocean and those around me, to sit and know what it is to be too hot, to let the waves wash the sand from under you and truly understand the scope of sediments moving. It’s faster than you think, grain by grain.

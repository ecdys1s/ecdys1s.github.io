The mind began where it could
At a base of relation
Following its past as a throughline to the present
It waited and watched itself reborn
And entered the body of the one now-living
But something was wrong
Something had followed the mind
Some age-old wisdom had gotten twisted in the root of the brainstem
Like a mass of weeds holding a swimmer’s body fast to the bottom of a lake
All she could do was struggle, catching distorted sunlight through the surface as the water moved above her, passing her by on its way to the river, the lake, the river, the sea. 

Once she looked around, she found the deep, murky-green pleasant
And plenty were there to keep her company
Though she spoke no word of fish
She felt that they were friendly
And desired that they’d stay around
So she began feeding them bits of herself, a fingernail at first, then a fingertip, and earlobe, a shaving off the arm
And they gulped greedily, and became her friends. But when she felt she could give no more, they left. And so she steeled her resolve. A finger. An arm. A toe. The calf. And eventually she found herself freed from the bottom. Relieving herself of her limbs came to her only after she accepted that there was no other way. But now, lacking propellers, she drifted in the current, pursued by the fish that now nipped freely at her flesh, her torso wasting away

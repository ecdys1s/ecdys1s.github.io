PUBLISH.ENTRY #38904
SETTING:BENEATH
AND BENEATH THE SKIN THERE FLOWED BLOOD OF MANY COLORS
\A SEETHING MASS GIVING LUSTRE TO THE SKIN AND STRENGTH TO THE MUSCLES
FROM THE FURTHEST FINGERTIPS TO JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE LEFT VENTRICLE
ITS TOUCH ELECTRIC
BUT THE SURFACE, UNABLE TO SEE THE POWER, THE WARMTH, THE FLOWING, RESENTED THAT WHICH GAVE IT LIFE
IT COULD ONLY SEE THE FORM IT IMPARTED, BLEAK AND DILUTED COMPARED TO THE SCARLET OXYGEN BELOW
AS MUCH TINT AS IT GAVE THE SKIN
THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE BENEATH
AND SO THE SKIN TURNED ITS BACK ON THE BLOOD
IT COVERED ITSELF IN DRAPES, SHEETS, OILS, SCREENS, HIDING ITS NATURE
AND WHEN CUT AND THE SECRETS BENEATH FLOWED OUT
IT SUPPRESSED THE FLOW, SCABBING IT OVER, TRAPPING THE BLOOD INSIDE. IT INJECTED NEW SUBSTANCES TO CHANGE THE BLOOD, TO ALTER ITS OWN SERUM, IN HOPES THAT THE CHANGES WOULD SPREAD TO THE SKIN, THE LUNGS, THE HEART, THE MIND
BUT THE BLOOD THICKENED AND RECOILED, TRAPPING ERRANT THOUGHTS WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE FLITTED IN AND OUT LIKE CAPTIVE PIGEONS ON A SUMMERS DAY
AND SO
THE SKIN AND THE BLOOD WERE AT WAR

Your voice rushes from my ears as i bat it away, tainting my vision of you with grievances and mild annoyances that take root and beg to be defied, but defy replacement. The queen of the mountain in my mind is first decided by the one I cannot have, and I invent weapons for her to use to knock challengers off one by one. I compare you to the others, and take you from yourself. You’re in my hands now, your image twisted and warped by what-ifs and until-whens and not-perfects. Your lack of taste offset by her fullness of it, her pretention offset by your silliness; your simple action offset by her full-throated creative energy, her strictness offset by your sweetness. Two against each other, each competing; whoever takes the pedestal is sure to be knocked off in the next bout, and this time, for sure, I’ll settle. I get caught in the process, i get caught in the process, i get caught in the process, i get caught in the process, i just get caught in the process
